# YAML session file example (session_yaml)
#
# This demonstrates a tmuxomatic session file in YAML format only.  For configuration
# in general, see the other session examples.
#
# Using YAML as the format for tmuxomatic sessions has one minor limitation, the first
# line of a YAML block literal cannot be indented.  This affects indenting the unlinked
# commands in the directions section (used in the other examples for readability).
#
# IMPORTANT: ALL comments will be lost when tmuxomatic writes to a YAML session file
# (for example, when using flex).  If you need to comment your session configurations,
# use shorthand, and don't comment on the same lines as the windowgram.
